# Costs

From the actors' Store pricing (regenerate with `scripts/sync-references.py`; CI fails when it is out of date).
Estimate with the Bronze column: the paid-plan price (Silver and Gold pay less), so no paid-plan user pays more than you said.
Where the Free column differs, free-plan users pay that price: at the approval, quote its figure too, in the same line ("This costs about USD 0.09 (about USD 0.17 on Apify's free plan), occasionally a little more if I need to dig deeper to answer you"), so they never pay more than you said either. These prices are for that one approval line before a yes (`running.md`, "Before any run"), never for cost lines elsewhere.
Every run also has a start event of $0.00005 per GB of memory.

## Estimate and spending limit

The approval line gives one estimate with a soft note: "This costs about USD 0.35, occasionally a little more if I need to dig deeper to answer you." No range, no ceiling and no spending-limit figure is said (`running.md`, "Before any run", items 4 to 6).
- **The estimate:** the counted worst case of what is planned (its high end), each event at its Bronze price × the count the input can return (change events included where the read repeats one this account made). Item 5's USD 0.25 bound for a go-ahead in the message compares the estimate, never the spending limit.
- **The spending limit (internal, never said):** max(1.5 × the estimate, the estimate + USD 0.15), from the estimate as said at the approval (the free-plan figure when higher), rounded up to the cent (said USD 0.17: limit USD 0.32); never above a budget or allowance the user gave. One run's `maxTotalChargeUsd` is the limit; several runs on one yes: each floored run gets its floor first (below), and the rest is split across the others in proportion to their high ends; when the floors together come to more than the limit, the limit is raised to their sum. It sits above the estimate so a job finishes instead of stopping part-way (owner's rule of 9 Nov 2026: a supplier read capped near its estimate stopped after 1 of 7 ideas; kept internal by the owner's change of 10 Nov 2026).
- **Floors** (per-search reserves the actor holds before it starts; a cap under one stops a read part-way): `supplier-price-finder`, its high end + USD 0.02 per idea per AliExpress or Alibaba source (+ USD 0.07 per idea when Made-in-China joins the single-unit check; the single-unit check on 5 ideas: 0.12 + 5 × 0.02 = USD 0.22); `marketplace-search-scanner`, its high end + USD 0.02 per keyword per service marketplace (eBay, Etsy, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowe's).
- **No yes needed** (estimate USD 0.05 or less): no line is said; the cap follows the same formula from the run's own high end.
- **Watches** keep their monthly estimate and their own Max cost per run (`watchlists.md`); this limit is for one-off checks.

- **The guided session (steps 1 to 3, one yes), by lens (`first-use.md`, "The approval line, per lens"), estimate said and spending limit (never said):** off Amazon without dropship about USD 0.55, limit USD 0.83 (the account's first run about USD 0.45, limit USD 0.68); on Amazon about USD 0.51, limit USD 0.77; dropship on Amazon about USD 0.61, limit USD 0.92; Etsy or eBay about USD 0.90 with dropship or USD 0.80 for print on demand (about USD 1.33 and 1.23 on the free plan), limits USD 2 and USD 1.85; dropship through ads about USD 0.69 (about USD 0.74 on the free plan), limit USD 1.11.
- The welcome itself runs nothing: its one cost line names no figure beyond Apify's free USD 5 a month.
